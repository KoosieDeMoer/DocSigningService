# DocSigningService
Cryptographic and Signature Image signing and non-repudiation transmission of PDFs

## Demo ##
The demo has three parts:

1. Creating doc signers with signature and initial images and digital certificates for signing PDFs
1. Signing docs (with signature images and cryptographically) with a 2FA to an emulated mobile device
1. Sending docs to another party with authentication and non-repudiation of sending and reading.
